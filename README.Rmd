# mscstts Package: 
The goal of `mscstts` is to provide an R Client for the Microsoft Cognitive Services Text to Speech REST API, including voice synthesis. A valid account MUST be registered at the Microsoft Cognitive Services website <https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/> in order to obtain a (free) API key. Without an API key, this package will not work properly.

See the documentation here: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/speech-service/overview

## Getting an API key

You can get a TTS API key here: https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/try/cognitive-services/.  The API you need to get one from is Cognitive Services, Speech.

1.  Create an Azure account
2.  Go to https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.CognitiveServicesSpeechServices.  If that works, skip to step 5.
3.  Go to https://portal.azure.com/#home
4. Click `+ Create a Resource`
5. Search "Speech"
6. Hit `+ Create`
7. Should be able to create an F0 account (which is free - see below) if you hit the pricing tiers

```{r, echo = FALSE, width = "10%"}
knitr::include_graphics("man/figures/README-f0.png")
```

### Setting up your API key

You can set up your API key in a number of ways (where `XXX` is your API key):

1. Edit `~/.Renviron` and set `MS_TTS_API_KEY = "XXXX"`
2. In `R`, use `options(ms_tts_key = "XXXX")`.
3. Set `export MS_TTS_API_KEY=XXXX` in `.bash_profile`/`.bashrc` if you're using `R` in the terminal.
4. Pass `api_key = "XXXX"` in arguments of functions such as `ms_list_voices(api_key = "XXXX")`.


## Installation

You can install `mscstts` from GitHub with:

```{r gh-installation, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("muschellij2/mscstts")
```


## Example

```{r, eval = TRUE}
library(mscstts)
if (ms_have_tts_key()) {
  res = ms_synthesize(
    script = "hey, how are you doing? I'm doing pretty good",
    output_format = "audio-16khz-128kbitrate-mono-mp3")
  tmp <- tempfile("example", fileext = ".mp3")
  writeBin(res$content, con = tmp)
  mp3 = tuneR::readMP3(tmp)
}
testthat::expect_true(file.size(tmp) > 50000)
if (interactive()) {
  player = tuneR::getWavPlayer()
  if (.Platform$OS.type == "windows" && is.null(player)) player = NULL
  if (.Platform$OS.type != "windows" && is.null(player)) player = "play"
  tuneR::play(mp3, player = player)
}
```
